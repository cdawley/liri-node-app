#### LIRI (Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface) App using NodeJS

This application takes instruction from the command line and returns (depending on the command issued) data from either Spotify, the Internet Movie Database, or Twitter. This was created as part of coursework when myself and other students were learning NodeJS.
